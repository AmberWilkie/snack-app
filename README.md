## To Do
- ~~Add languages for users~~
- ~~Install `has_friendship` so users can friend each other~~
- ~~Deploy app for staging / testing~~
- Figure out how users can find others whose languages match up (interests from AM?)
- Install a messaging service so users can message each other
- ~~Style and sanitize params for login, edit user registration~~
- ~~Create a nav bar~~
- Get Foundation Javascript working for a "real" nav bar
- Find a cool background image / images to spice the place up
- Create forums so users can post publicly
- Install an admin interface so users and forum posts can be monitored for inappropriate activity
- Research security settings and make sure user data is not compromisable
- Add photos for users
- Install i18n translation for at least Swedish, hopefully other languages too (will need help - Arabic, anyone?)
- Style flash messages
- Users' language list should be links to lists of users who speak / want to speak those languages
- Production deployment to Digital Ocean
- Language and Learning lists need to populate with the values already in the database.
